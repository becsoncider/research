Codes 
 
Functions and Methods: 
__init__ - init is a code that helps code run smoothly, without having to re-code all the background code each time. Init helps it run more automatically 
__str__ - str stands for string. This code helps the user experience of your code by making it nicer, and tidier. 
def - def stands for define. This code defines what class you are using. 
input - Input is the code used when you are asking for the user of your code to input information. 
 
Statements: 
print - Print is a code used when you wish to print something into output text. 
Import - Import is a code used when importing external code into your code. It saves the coder 
a lot of time by not having to code it themselves. Often, extneral code comes from places 
like the Python library.
 
Control Structures: 
if, else - if else is a common code that determines the result based on what the user inputs. It is essentially a true or false statement.
If the user enters an answer that is ‘true’ the results will differ than if the user enters a code that is ‘false’ 
while - While is a code that is used in conjunction with loop. A while loop is used to keep the code running so long as the code running is not ‘true’ 
loop - Loop is a code syntax that makes a code repeat itself without writing it out over and over. 
 
Input/Output 
\n - \n is a code that is used to create new lines – the new lines will be displayed during user experience. 
 
 
Miscellaneous  
main - Main is used when code officially starts running and doing what it was designed to do. 
class - Class is used for creating objects, and allows you to group functions together, creating an object. 
f... - This stands for an F string. An F string in code indicates that the string is formatted. Formatting the string makes it 
tidier and easier to read.
